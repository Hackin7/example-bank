BMS is now the largest VA contributor to the manufacturing sector in Singapore and has rapidly grown to become the fourth pillar of the economy. In fact, eight of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies have facilities in Singapore, with four of the top 10 medications by global revenue manufactured there

Other than developing cutting-edge innovations to lead our biomedical manufacturing sector, Singapore’s biomedical science (BMS) sector  also provides much employment for highly-skilled labour. A*Star has embarked on an aggressive talent development programme to attract Singaporeans to join the BMS through scholarships and fellowship"

3/25/2020 1:16:47,Microsensor Breakthrough (December 2019),"Singapore, Science, Technology, Medicine","Problem:
1. <code>Cardiac</code> devices such as pacemakers are crucial for monitoring a person's heart rhythms, but the procedure to implant them is <code>invasive</code> and comes with the risks of <code>infection</code> and <code>skin bruising</code>
2. When the devices run out of battery power a few years later, they have to be replaced through another invasive surgical operation.
3. Sometimes, the outline of these devices also protrudes from the skin

Solution
1. <code>NUS researchers</code> have invented a sensor that is smaller than the tip of a pencil, and can be implanted under the skin using just a syringe. 
2. It is also wireless and does not require a battery, which means it could technically last forever. 
3. More importantly, the signals that the tiny device sends can be read clearly and easily.

Besides monitoring cardiac rhythms, this microsensor also allows monitoring of other health conditions. This includes monitoring blood glucose in diabetic patients without the need for multiple pinpricks in the fingers to draw blood for testing"

Solution
1. <code>AWAK technologies</code>, a Singaporean invented the artificial kidney, worn externally, which consists of a permanent pump and a disposable cartridge that acts as an advanced filter to clear toxins from the body

2. Plastic waste, including food packaging, rose to a high of <code>869,000</code> tonnes

Solution
1. <code>NUS</code> researchers may have found an environment-friendly food packaging material that slows down fungal and microbial growth, and is free of chemicals
2. This allows food products to last longer in their packaging, with little, or no chemical preservatives needed
3. By being able to extend food products’ shelf life, food wastage can be minimized, leading to an increase in cost savings and protection for our environment
4. Still being further tested"
